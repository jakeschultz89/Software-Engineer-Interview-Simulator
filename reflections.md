1. This weekend I drafted my proposal, began my README.md, and started framing out the coding.
2. I am hoping to get more of my coding done to at least have a start screen.
3. The biggest blockers on my list are deciding on how to format my gameplay.

# Tuesday
- [x] What did you achieve yesterday?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I completed my wireframe and I got a lot of my basic coding down.
2. Today my goal is to have a fully functioning game. 
3. My biggest blocker I have right now is I cannot figure out how to show code within my game. The things I have found on google and tried still just make what I want to display into actual code for the site. For example, I want the answers to a trivia question to be <ol>, <ul>, <list>, <nl>, but that doesn't show up on the trivia card. Instead it puts bullet points or is blank. My current workaround is to leave of the <> but I am hoping to fix that.
