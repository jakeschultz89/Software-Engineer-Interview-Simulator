# Proposal of Game
I want to make a trivia game called 'Software Engineer Interview Simulator'

The point of the game will be to answer multiple choice questions while a timer counts down. The number of questions answered correctly will determine the outcome for the player (whether they get denied the job/get hired but at a lower salary/hired at a higher salary/etc).

I am unsure if I want to have the timer being short and resetting at each question or have one long timer count down the entire time.

For example:
                10 second timer for each of the 10 questions

                60 second timer that runs once for while all 10 questions are answered

At the end of the questions, the outcome will be shown with a graphic congratulating the player and showing their score.
